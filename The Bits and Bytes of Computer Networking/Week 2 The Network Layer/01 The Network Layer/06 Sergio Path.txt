My name is Sergio La Torre, and I'm a Network Engineer at Google. When I was, just like a young kid, I like analog tools like screwdrivers and drills, and then, I like taking things apart. And then, as I got older in my teenage years, I realized it could take apart computers, and then, that really interested me because when you opened it up, it was like fans, like lights, like the circuitry. And I just didn't understand it, didn't make sense to me but if I knew, if I put it together the right way. I could actually interact with it and have fun and play my video games off of it. And that's how it really started. And by time I remember I've got a little older, outside of high school, I realized I could make this like a passion and actually like really learn how this technology works. I think the favorite part is solving the problems, I really enjoy when we get to see a Diego from one device to another, and how things communicate, and how the customers enjoy it, I've gained so many different tools and skills, and now, I feel like a swiss army knife when I'm working. And there's so many different experiences that I can bring back to solve problems I face today. Early starting off as an Internal Network Technician, I had a project to upgrade a firewall for a Police Department, and a firewall basically is used as security appliance, and the entry point to the network. We thought it worked it went through successfully until I got a phone call, very late at night that things were broken. And when we realized that emails, and new police calls, were not going through and that the upgrade failed, and at that point I realize the magnitude of things that I am working on, can affect people's lives. And it can cause harm, and it can cause good. So it was really a good humbling experience for me when I was working on a project.
