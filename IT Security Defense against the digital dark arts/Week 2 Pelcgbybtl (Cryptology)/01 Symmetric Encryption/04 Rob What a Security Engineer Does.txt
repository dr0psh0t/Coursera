My name Rob Anthony and I work as a Security Engineer on the Access Control Infrastructure Team. Some servers you only want certain people to access, say that they are sensitive. The financial systems is only the financial team should access them. So, that's what we do. We control the policies that give people access to certain things within Google. A security engineer is responsible for making sure that Google is protected. One of the big things that people want to do is monitor their servers. They have a server sets up, they want to be able to make sure that it's actually up. Need to have someone monitor there, or they might want to be able to access it remotely to be able to manage it. This machine might be across the country at some data center. Imagine if I'm talking to you and telling you something and there's a malicious person sitting next to us. If we're talking just plainly, then that malicious person can hear us. If we're talking through code encrypted channel, that person can't hear us. So, if someone has a design and they say, "Yeah, we just want to keep it simple. We just want to use Telnet." We'll be like, "Oh, no, no, no. I know setting up something much more secure is a little bit more about here. So, the reason why this is why you should do that."
