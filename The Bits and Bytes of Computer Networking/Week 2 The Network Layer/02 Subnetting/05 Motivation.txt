If something is stumping you or you feel stuck at a certain aspect, there's always someone else who's going through the same thing. Anytime I started to feel overwhelmed by information or I just wasn't getting it. I wasted so much time being unsure of myself that I should have just listened to my friends and family when they said just do it, you can do it. One of the greatest thing that helped me to get back motivating is the accessibility of the course on my phone, I was just able to go into the app and listen to a few videos because I can learn on the go. Having a network of people that motivates you, it's so fundamental. Even if it's a friend or it is a family members that you can get from the beginning, and he can be there for you on your corner like a coach. Don't be afraid to ask for help, whether it be from your peers, from your coaches, friends, family. There's always someone who knows more and you can learn from them.
